Dear editor,

Please consider for publication in the neuroimage special issue on the
connectom the following manuscript *'Learning and comparing functional
connectomes across subjects'*.

The manuscript combines a synthetic review of many different aspects of
estimation and comparing of functional connectivity across subjects with
practical aspects of data processing that have not yet been exposed
together in a single consistent publication.

Yours sincerely,

 GaÃ«l Varoquaux and R. Cameron Craddock
