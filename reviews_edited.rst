It would be good to start the introduction with a definition of functional connectivity.

Minor remarks
--------------

1.	Perhaps consideration can
be given to briefly flagging the issues that are unique to task-based
connectome inference.  

Trivial points
==============

1.	Using "the connectome" is probably a misnomer, particularly in
the context of functional connectomics. Functional connectomes can differ
vastly depending on the technique used to infer edge connectivity, which
is a detail this article has demonstrated very clearly. Perhaps "the
connectome" is a term that should be reserved for structural
connectomics.
